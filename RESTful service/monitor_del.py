This demo shows how to use the RESTful API to upload an audio file ( "data_type":"audio" ) into your bucket.
You can find account_access_key and account_access_secret in your account page.
Log into http://console.acrcloud.com -> "Account" (top right corner) -> "RESTful API Keys" -> "Create Key Pair". 
Be Careful, they are different with access_key and access_secret of your project.
